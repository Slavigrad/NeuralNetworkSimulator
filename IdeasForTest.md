Here’s a **beginner‐friendly** setup you can use in your presentation—something that is small, trains quickly, and demonstrates the “magic” of a neural network in a way people with no ML background can grasp. The most classic example is **XOR** (exclusive‐OR), because it shows how a neural network can learn a pattern that a single layer can’t solve.

---

## 1) **Number of Inputs and Input Values**

- **Use 2 inputs** (call them \(x_1\) and \(x_2\)).
- If you want to demonstrate an **XOR** problem, the inputs and expected outputs are:
    - (0, 0) → 0
    - (0, 1) → 1
    - (1, 0) → 1
    - (1, 1) → 0

It’s simple, easy to visualize, and famously **cannot be solved** with a single linear neuron. That’s where the hidden layer comes in!

## 2) **Number of Neurons in One Hidden Layer**

- **One hidden layer** with **2 neurons** is enough to solve XOR.
- This makes the network small enough that your friends can see all the weights and watch them change during Single Step training.

```
2 inputs -> (2 neurons in hidden layer) -> 1 output
```

---

## 3) **Number of Output Neurons**

- For XOR, **use 1 output neuron** that you want to be near 0 for false and near 1 for true.
- Or you can keep your default 2 outputs if you want to show a multi-output structure, but for a straightforward XOR demonstration, 1 output is perfect.

---

## 4) **Activation Function**

- **Sigmoid** (a.k.a. logistic) is the **classic** choice for XOR demonstrations.
    - It outputs values between 0 and 1, which maps nicely to the idea of “false” vs. “true.”
- ReLU works too, but if you want the canonical “textbook XOR,” pick Sigmoid so you can easily compare output to 0 or 1.

---

## 5) **Loss Function**

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** is totally fine for a beginner.
- This is easy to understand: the network tries to minimize the average squared difference between the prediction and the target (0 or 1).

---

## 6) **Learning Rate**

- Pick something that **trains in a handful of steps but isn’t too jumpy**.
- For a small XOR network, something like **0.1** or **0.2** often works well.
- If you pick 0.01, it might learn too slowly for a live demo.

---

## 7) **Training Speed**

- Set it to **Slow** or do **Single Step** mode so you can watch each weight update.
- This is precisely where the “aha!” moment comes—seeing the weights change after every step is super instructive for beginners.

---

## 8) **Batch Size**

- For XOR, you can do **batch size = 1** (online learning) to keep it simple.
- Alternatively, you might sample all 4 XOR inputs at once with batch size = 4 (full batch).
- The difference here is small for such a tiny dataset, so feel free to do whichever is easier to visualize.

---

## 9) **Momentum**

- You can **leave Momentum off (0)** or set it to a modest value like **0.8** or **0.9**.
- Momentum can help the network converge a bit faster and smooth out weight updates, but for XOR, it’s not strictly necessary.

## Suggested Config at a Glance

1. **Inputs**: 2  \(\bigl(x_1, x_2\bigr)\)
2. **Hidden Layer**: 1 layer with 2 neurons
3. **Output**: 1 neuron (final result ~ 0 or 1)
4. **Activation**: Sigmoid
5. **Loss Function**: Mean Squared Error
6. **Learning Rate**: 0.1 (or 0.2)
7. **Training Speed**: Slow (or Single Step)
8. **Batch Size**: 1 (or 4)
9. **Momentum**: 0.8–0.9 or even 0

## Explaination

- **“We have two inputs, each can be 0 or 1. We want the output to be true (1) if exactly one input is 1, false (0) if both inputs match (both 0 or both 1).”**
- In each “Single Step,” the network does:
    1. **Forward pass:** It calculates the output based on the current weights.
    2. **Compare to target (0 or 1):** Finds the difference (error).
    3. **Backward pass:** Adjusts the weights to reduce that error.
- After enough steps, the network “figures out” the XOR pattern.

You will get to see how a small neural network can learn something that a single linear neuron cannot. This “XOR” example is famously the reason researchers realized **hidden layers** are crucial for tackling more complex tasks.
